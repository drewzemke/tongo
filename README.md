## Installation

### Using `cargo`

Install [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), then install:
```shell
cargo install tongo
```

### Using `nix`

Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/), then clone this repo and install:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:drewzemke/tongo.git
cd tongo
nix-build
```

Then you can move the created binary somewhere on your path:
```shell
cp ./result/bin/tongo /usr/local/bin/tongo
```

## Quick Start

1. Launch `tongo` in your terminal of choice:
```shell
tongo
```
2. Start creating a new connection by pressing `A`
3. Set a name for the connection and enter your database's connection string
4. After connecting, select a database and then a connection to connect to
5. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the data. Press `n` and `p` to move between pages

At any time (except when inputting text), you can bring up a commands list by pressing `?` that will explain what actions are available to you and what their keybindings are.


## Usage

Load a connection directly:
```shell
tongo --url mongodb://localhost:27017 
```

If you've previously stored a connection, you can load it by name:
```shell
tongo --connection local
```

Restore your most-recently-closed session in the app:
```shell
tongo --last
```


## Configuration

The first time you run `tongo`, a `config.toml` will be created for you in `~/.config/tongo` on Mac and Linux and in `<your-user-folder>\AppData\Roaming\tongo` on Windows. (You can also see that file [here](./assets/default-config.toml).) It contains a full commented-out configuration together with descriptions of each configuration point.
